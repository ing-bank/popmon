    Note that the (filename based) wildcards such as * apply to all statistic names matching that pattern.
    For example, ``"*_pull"`` applies for all features to all statistics ending on "_pull".
    You can also specify rules for specific features and/or statistics by leaving out wildcard and putting the
    feature name in front. E.g.

    .. code-block:: python

        monitoring_rules = {
            "featureA:*_pull": [5, 3, -3, -5],
            "featureA:nan": [4, 1, 0, 0],

            "nan": [8, 1, 0, 0],

    In case of multiple rules could apply for a feature's statistic, the most specific one applies.

    for all other features.
