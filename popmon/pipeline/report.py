    :param dict hists: input histograms to be profiled and monitored over time.
    :param reference_type: type or reference used for comparisons. Options [self, external, rolling, expanding].
        default is 'self'.
    :param reference: histograms used as reference. default is None
    :param str time_axis: name of datetime feature, used as time axis, eg 'date'. auto-guessed when not provided.
    :param int window: size of rolling window and/or trend detection. default is 10.
    :param int shift: shift of time-bins in rolling/expanding window. default is 1.
    :param dict monitoring_rules: monitoring rules to generate traffic light alerts.
        The default setting is:

        .. code-block:: python

            monitoring_rules = {
                "*_pull": [7, 4, -4, -7],
                "*_zscore": [7, 4, -4, -7],
                "[!p]*_unknown_labels": [0.5, 0.5, 0, 0],
            }

        Note that the (filename based) wildcards such as * apply to all statistic names matching that pattern.
        For example, ``"*_pull"`` applies for all features to all statistics ending on "_pull".
        You can also specify rules for specific features and/or statistics by leaving out wildcard and putting the
        feature name in front. E.g.

        .. code-block:: python

            monitoring_rules = {
                "featureA:*_pull": [5, 3, -3, -5],

                "*_pull": [7, 4, -4, -7],
                "nan": [8, 1, 0, 0],
            }

        In case of multiple rules could apply for a feature's statistic, the most specific one applies.
        So in case of the statistic "nan": "featureA:nan" is used for "featureA", and the other "nan" rule
        for all other features.
    :param dict pull_rules: red and yellow (possibly dynamic) boundaries shown in plots in the report.
        Default is:

        .. code-block:: python

            pull_rules = {"*_pull": [7, 4, -4, -7]}

        This means that the shown yellow boundaries are at -4, +4 standard deviations around the (reference) mean,
        and the shown red boundaries are at -7, +7 standard deviations around the (reference) mean.
        Note that the (filename based) wildcards such as * apply to all statistic names matching that pattern.
        (The same string logic applies as for monitoring_rules.)
    :param list features: histograms to pick up from the 'hists' dictionary (default is all keys)

    :param int last_n: plot statistic data for last 'n' periods (optional)
    :param int plot_hist_n: plot histograms for last 'n' periods. default is 2 (optional)

    :param bool extended_report: if True, show all the generated statistics in the report (optional)
    :param list show_stats: list of statistic name patterns to show in the report. If None, show all (optional)

            }

        In the bin specs for x:y, x is not provided (here) and reverts to the 1-dim setting.
        The 'bin_width', 'bin_offset' notation makes an open-ended histogram (for that feature) with given bin width
        and offset. The notation 'num', 'low', 'high' gives a fixed range histogram from 'low' to 'high' with 'num'
        number of bins.
    :param time_width: bin width of time axis. str or number (ns). note: bin_specs takes precedence. (optional)

                      anything understood by pd.Timedelta(time_width).value

    :param time_offset: bin offset of time axis. str or number (ns). note: bin_specs takes precedence. (optional)

        .. code-block:: text

            Examples: '1-1-2020', 0 (number of ns since 1-1-1970),
                      anything parsed by pd.Timestamp(time_offset).value
