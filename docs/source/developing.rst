Working on the package
----------------------
You have some cool feature and/or algorithm you want to add to the package. How do you go about it?

First clone the package.

.. code-block:: bash

  git clone https://github.com/popmon/popmon.git

then

.. code-block:: bash

  pip install -e popmon/

this will install ``popmon`` in editable mode, which will allow you to edit the code and run it as
you would with a normal installation of the ``popmon`` package.

To make sure that everything works first execute the unit tests.
For this you'll need to install our test requirements:

.. code-block:: bash

  cd popmon/
  pip install -r .[test]
  pytest

That's it!
